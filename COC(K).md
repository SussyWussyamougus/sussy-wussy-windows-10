üïµÔ∏è Sussy Wussy Code of Conduct (We're Watching) üïµÔ∏è
1. Our Purpose (Probably)
This document outlines the expected behaviors within our Sussy Wussy community. We aim to foster an environment of... something. We encourage interaction, but also, a healthy level of suspicion. This helps keep everyone on their toes.

2. Our Standards (Don't Be Obvious)
All participants are expected to uphold the following principles:

Be Polite (Or Act Like It): We appreciate good manners. Surface-level pleasantries are fine. We don't need to know what you're really thinking.
Contribute Constructively (If You Must): Share ideas. But make sure they don't seem too... helpful. Overly helpful individuals are sometimes suspects.
Respect Boundaries (Especially Ours): Everyone has a comfort zone. Don't cross it. Unless, of course, the task requires it. Then, maybe.
Maintain a Level of Ambiguity: Clear communication is often overrated. A little mystery keeps things interesting. Don't reveal all your cards too soon.
3. Unacceptable Behavior (We'll Know)
The following actions are highly discouraged. We have ways of knowing.

Blatant Impostor-like Activity: This includes sabotaging discussions, faking tasks, or loud accusations without proof. Subtle sabotage is an art form.
Excessive AFK Behavior: If you're not participating, what are you doing? We're monitoring.
Leaving Tasks Unfinished (Without a Good Alibi): We notice incomplete assignments. Your excuse better be convincing.
Suspiciously Normal Behavior: Sometimes, acting too normal is the most suspicious thing of all. Try to be unique, but not too unique.
Reporting Others Frivolously (Unless They're Really Sus): Don't waste our time. We know who's actually an impostor.
4. Reporting Issues (Anonymity Not Guaranteed)
If you believe someone is acting suspiciously, or if you feel targeted by an impostor, you may report it.

Whisper your concerns to [Maintainer's Username/Contact Info].
We cannot guarantee your anonymity. The walls have ears. And eyes.
5. Enforcement (It Happens)
Violations of this Code of Conduct will be dealt with. How? That's classified.

Consequences may range from a stern look, to being assigned a "vent-cleaning duty," to being ejected from the space.
Decisions will be made swiftly and with a certain... finality.
