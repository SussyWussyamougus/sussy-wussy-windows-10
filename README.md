ðŸ’£ Sussy Wussy Windows 10: The Operating System That's Kinda Sus ðŸ’£
What In Tarnation IS This?
Well, partner, you've stumbled upon Sussy Wussy Windows 10. Is it a real operating system? Does it actually do anything useful? The answer to both is a resounding... maybe? Look, we had some free time, a questionable amount of caffeine, and a deep-seated appreciation for things that are just a little bit off. This is the result. Use at your own risk. And maybe don't store your life savings on it.

"Features" (Use That Term Loosely)
The Taskbar That Side-Eyes You: Sometimes it looks normal. Sometimes... you're not so sure.
Random "Emergency Meeting" Notifications: Just pops up. No context. You decide the emergency.
"Vent System" File Explorer: Navigating your files has never felt so... clandestine.
The Recycle Bin is a Literal Trash Compactor Sound: Deleting files is now a dramatic event.
Cursor Occasionally Goes on "Errands": Don't be surprised if your mouse pointer takes a little walk. It usually comes back. Usually.
Built-in "Who's the Impostor?" Minigame: Because why not interrupt your workflow with a quick accusation?
System Sounds Replaced with Suspicious Whispers: You'll never hear a normal error sound again.
Installation (Proceed With Caution)
We're not entirely sure how you'd install this on a real machine, and frankly, we're a little scared to find out. Maybe run it in a heavily sandboxed VM? Or just look at the screenshots and imagine? That's probably the safest bet.

Seriously, don't actually try to install this on your main computer. We are not responsible for any existential crises or corrupted boot drives that may occur.

Usage (Good Luck)
If you somehow manage to get this running, congratulations (and maybe seek professional help). Just... click around? Try not to break anything (though that might be part of the fun?). Don't expect stability. Expect the unexpected. Expect to question your life choices.

Why Did We Make This? (The Honest Truth)
We thought it would be funny. Did we succeed? You be the judge.

Contributing (If You're Feeling Particularly Chaotic)
Got a terrible idea for a "feature"? Think you can make the system even more unsettling? Fork this (hypothetical) repository and unleash your inner agent of chaos. We might even be impressed. Or terrified. It's a fine line.

License (Use Responsibly...ish)
This "operating system" is provided "as is," with all its quirks and potential for digital mayhem. We're pretty sure there isn't a real license involved here, but if there were, it would probably say something along the lines of "Don't blame us if your computer starts acting sus."

You have been warned. Now go forth (or maybe just stay put and watch cat videos).
